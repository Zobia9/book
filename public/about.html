                Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores.
                We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. <br> <br> They’re where authors can connect with
                readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a
                lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities. <br>
                <br>
                As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get
                your books and support bookstores at the same time. <br>
                <br>
                If you want to find a specific local bookstore to support, find them on our map and they’ll receive the full
                profit off your order. <br> Otherwise, your order will contribute to an earnings pool that will be evenly
                distributed among independent bookstores (even those that don’t use Bookshop). <br>
                <br>
                We also support anyone who advocates for books through our affiliate program, which pays a 10% commission on
                every sale, and gives a matching 10% to independent bookstores. <br> <br> If you are an author, a website or magazine,
                have a bookclub, an organization that wants to recommend books, or even just a book-lover with an Instagram
                feed, you can sign up to be an affiliate, start your own shop, and be rewarded for your advocacy of books.<br> <br>
                Bookshop wants to give back to everyone who promotes books, authors, and independent bookstores! <br> <br>
                By design, we give away over 75% of our profit margin to stores, publications, authors and others who make
                up the thriving, inspirational culture around books! <br> <br>
                We hope that Bookshop can help strengthen the fragile ecosystem and margins around bookselling and keep
                local bookstores an integral part of our culture and communities. <br> <br>
                Bookshop is a B-Corp - a corporation dedicated to the public good.
